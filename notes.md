## Character Menu Appearance

Offset: 128

Bit 141: Weapon

Codes:

0D: Morning Star
0F: Flail
12: Sabre/Scimitar
13: Falchion
14: Crystal Sword
15: Broad Sword

Bits 137-140 || 144-145 -- Armor

As far as I can tell, bits 137-140 decide the visuals of the body armor, and 144-145 decide the shoulderpads.
